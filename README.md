# VaultServer
This is a web application for managing cryptocurrencies, built with Django and Channels for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. The application includes a web wallet for storing and managing multiple cryptocurrencies, and uses web sockets to provide real-time updates on account balances and transaction status.

The backend is built using Django and Channels, which allows for asynchronous communication between the server and client using web sockets. The application includes multiple microservices for handling different functionalities such as authentication, transaction processing, and account management.

The frontend is built using Svelte, a lightweight JavaScript framework that allows for efficient rendering of dynamic content. The user interface includes features such as account creation and management, cryptocurrency exchange, transaction history, and real-time balance updates.

The repository includes code for both the backend and frontend, along with documentation on how to set up and run the application locally. The project follows best practices for code organization and includes tests for ensuring code quality and functionality.

Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive solution for building a cryptocurrency web wallet using modern technologies and best practices.
